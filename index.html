    <h1>ARCHES is more than a program.
    </h1>
    <h2 class="by">Interviews and testimonies by Jesus Cerda</h2>
    <h2 class="intro-header">ARCHES is a program that provides mentoring to young adults ages 16-24. It has demonstrated the ability to reduce participants' recidivism. Arches was launched in 2012 as a component of the New York City Young Men's Initiative with private funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies and oversight from the Mayor's office for economic opportunity. Arches is managed by the NYC Department of Probation and currently operates with City funding at 13 sites across the five boroughs. I decided to inform others about how important this program has been for young adults. Many youths have changed their life thanks to it.

    <h3 class="experience-header">My experience</h3>
    <p class="info1">
        I think that the youth are motivated by the program because of all the information it provides. They are learning how to make a positive change in the community by avoiding negative influences and doing the right thing. They are assigned a mentor with whom they can talk openly and receive advice without being afraid of being judged. This program gives its participants a stipend for their participation as well as food, metro cards and even a raffle contest for punctual participants.

        I had a great experience in this program. There was always something new to learn at each group meeting I attended. I learned that you must appreciate what you have and adhere to the law because you could risk losing everything. I only missed one group meeting. We took several trips, food and drinks were included, and sometimes we would receive movie tickets. Also, we participated in a culinary program where we learned to clean and cut vegetables. There is a lot to gain from this program, especially knowledge.

    <p class="info2">ARCHES is a place where any youth can find a setting that incorporates positive values, principles and practices. I graduated from Arches on 2018, and I still participate in its groups. I have received an excellent treatment from its staff including my mentor. Also, I used and still think that there should be an Arches for young adults that are not on probation, that way they can be shown the right path early on. Arches operates Mondays and Thursdays from 5PM to 7PM on 127 West 127th Street, Rm 127. You must be on probation to start the program but no to finish it.
